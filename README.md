Motivation : 
As students, we spend a large portion of our time studying for tests and exams. With productivity mobile applications, like Forest, rising in popularity in recent years, we believe that there is an educational space in the application realm currently left untapped. With proper market research, peer review and focus groups, our team has decided to launch a bot in Discord to tap into these spaces. Through a combination of elements typical of a productivity app, the incorporation of a Gamification system, and the integration of tools that aids in active recall, students will be able to utilise our Discord bot to start studying, maximise their productive hours, and learn about the wonders of our world in a safe space.

Why Discord:
With a reported 250 million registered users around the world, an active user base of 56 million monthly, and a social media platform that significantly comprises the younger audiences, our target population, this social media platform is a great avenue to explore for our bot. Furthermore, discordjs is a developed framework with extensive utilities that can aid in the creation of our bot, and aligns with our interests.

Aim :
We aim to build a user-friendly Discord bot to provide a space for individuals who are venturing into trying different study techniques and exploring their studying style, while providing an incentive for users to continue studying. 

User Stories :
1. As a user who does not know about the various studying technique and method, I want to learn more about it 
2. I would like to experiment different study techniques
3. Users will be able to experiment and try different study techniques available, such as pomodoro, 52-17, 90 minutes block, 1-3-5, etc
4. I would like to be able to scale up and down certain conventional study techniques. For example: using a 50minutes-10minutes cycle on a Pomodoro studying technique, instead of the conventional 25minutes-5minutes cycle.
